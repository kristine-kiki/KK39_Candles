                    At KK39 Candles, we believe what goes into our candles is just as important as the beautiful light they cast. 
                    We are committed to using high-quality, responsibly sourced ingredients.

                <h3 class="mt-4">Our Wax</h3>
                <p>
                    We primarily use [e.g., 100% natural soy wax, a coconut-soy blend, etc.]. 
                    This wax is chosen for its clean burn, excellent scent throw, and eco-friendly properties. 
                    [Add more details: renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic, etc.]
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">Our Wicks</h3>
                <p>
                    Our candles feature [e.g., cotton wicks, wooden wicks]. They are [e.g., lead-free, zinc-free] 
                    to ensure a safe and clean burning experience. [Mention if they are self-trimming or require specific care].
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Our Fragrances</h3>
                <p>
                    We use a blend of [e.g., premium fragrance oils and pure essential oils]. 
                    All our fragrances are [e.g., phthalate-free, paraben-free, cruelty-free]. 
                    [Mention specific standards or certifications if applicable].
